            <ul>
               	<li><a href="pages/law1.html">The First Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>The great view is always a ground-based view.</p>
            	<li><a href="pages/law2.html">The Second Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>The great view is enhanced by the method and path used to approach the view.</p>
            	<li><a href="pages/law3.html">The Third Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>The great view is enhanced by direct experience with geographical details within the expanse of the view.</p>
            	<li><a href="pages/law4.html">The Fourth Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>The great view is enhanced by knowing historical details about places within the expanse of the view.</p>
            	<li><a href="pages/law5.html">The Fifth Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>The great view is enhanced by geological knowledge, both structural and temporal, of the landscape within the expanse of the view.</p>
            	<li><a href="pages/law6.html">The Sixth Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>An ensemble of great views within sight of one another will enhance each great view.</p>
            	<li><a href="pages/law7.html">The Seventh Law of the Great View</a></li>
                <p>The great view both diminishes and expands the viewer's sense of self.</p>
