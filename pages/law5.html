                <p>THE JAGGED PARALLEL RIDGES, KNOWN AS HOGBACKS, SEEN ABOVE IN UTAH'S CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL PARK, ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU'S EROSION SURFACE INTERSECTING THE WATERPOCKET FOLD, AN IMMENSE MONOCLINE OF TRIASSIC SEDIMENTS. THE CROSS SECTION MAKES EVIDENT THE GREAT SCALE OF GEOLOGIC STRUCTURE AS COMPARED TO THE RELATIVELY MODEST RELIEF OF THE LANDSCAPE.</p>

                <h3>Accessing Deep Time . . .</h3>
                <p>A modicum of geological knowledge can let a landscape viewer see far beyond human history into the past, accessing deep time and bringing into the scene a vision of slow landforming processes that unfold over tens or hundreds of millions of years. With an eye for such geological activity, the viewer will watch mountains rise and wear away, sedimentary layers thicken, bend, and fold over, volcanic rifts spread lava over hundreds of miles, and oceans encroach and retreat from beyond the horizon. Where rocks are exposed by an arid climate, and sedimentary rock formations stretch out flat for hundreds of miles, the ability to see into the distant geological past is particularly favored.</p>
                <h3>. . . and Crustal Depths</h3>
                <p>In a complementary turn of mind, one can also see down into the hidden volume of the earth's crust by observing the shape of rock strata where they are bent and broken at the surface. Where rock layers strike up across an eroding landscape surface, their sharp angles indicate that they continue down thousands of feet, while up into the air above, thousands of feet of hard rock are now long gone, the elements and gravity having combined over ages of geologic time to lower the land's surface to where it temporarily lies today. This is a dynamic landscape, in an ongoing process of change, erosion and sedimentation going hand-in-hand to resculpture the scene before us.</p>
                <h3>The Preeminent Geological Landscape</h3>
                <p>The Colorado Plateau is perhaps the best place to experience these feats of geological imagination. The solidity of this miles-thick slab of hard sedimentary layers has left it only slightly cracked and bent after having been pushed up thousands of feet from below sea level.  Viewed from a heightened vista, Navajo Mountain being the best, the overall pattern of folding and faulting matches the scale of the vast plateau. But down inside the warps and cracks of the plateau, the immense circular cliffs, hogbacks, mesas, and stepped plateaus that express this pattern dwarf anything that humans have placed in the scene.</p>
                <p>One is struck with an awareness that, great as is the scale of topographic relief in a rugged landscape like Utah's Capitol Reef, the rock structure, with its folded and tilted layers diving thousands of feet beneath the surface, is so much grander in scale than the relatively minor relief of the erosion surface.</p>
