                <p>PORTIONS OF THESE DESERT MUD FLATS FILL WITH WATER JUST A FEW INCHES DEEP DURING THE SPRING RUNOFF EACH YEAR. THEY DRY UP ENOUGH IN MID-SUMMER THAT ONE CAN DRIVE A CAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS THEM. DURING PLEISTOCENE GLACIATIONS THESE LOWLANDS BECAME DEEP FRESHWATER LAKES, AS SHOWN IN THE GEOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF LAKE LAHONTAN IN THE MAP ABOVE. THE SMOKE CREEK DESERT, ABOVE, SEEN IN THE VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT OF GRANITE PEAK ABOVE GERLACH, NEVADA, IS A FORMER EMBAYMENT OF THIS LAKE, LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF BLACK ROCK DESERT NEAR TO THE CALIFORNIA/NEVADA BORDER. IN THE VIEW WEST FROM GRANITE PEAK ONE CAN SEE A SPRING BELOW THE EPONYMOUS BLACK ROCK THAT SERVED AS AN OASIS FOR WAGON TRAIN PIONEERS CROSSING THE DESERT ON THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA.</p>

                <h3>Traveling through Time</h3>
                <p>Similar to the effect of the Third Law, awareness of historical details about a landscape unveiled before one transports the viewer to a different time or era, transforming the view in the imagination.  Highways and cities disappear from the scene and the mind's eye sees a landscape less trammeleld by the onslaught of humanity.</p>
                <p>The view from the summit of Granite Mountain above Gerlach, Nevada affords a good example of this law in practice. A branch of the California Trail crosses the desert that is lain out before the viewer. Below a small but prominent solid black rock, which is really an immense and rugged mountain, is a hot spring with fresh clean water that served as a waystation for the pioneers in their two-stage desert crossing. Looking upon the scene one can imagine the wagon trains passing over the dusty flat valley floor from one mountain range to the other. Gazing back further in time, this land was once home to native Paiutes, and the only trails were those walked in the hunt or on trading missions to other tribes.</p>
                <h3>Back to the Pluvial Stage</h3>
                <p>An even more amazing element of the historical scene displayed from Granite Mountain's summit is the awareness that these desert flats are the dried-up beds of a vast ancient lake filled with waters from the melting glaciers of a geologically recent Ice Age. The so-called Pluvial Stage, the latter portion of which saw humans inhabited this landscape, was a time when the basins throughout Utah and Nevada filled to overflowing, the waters in many cases finding their way out of the Great Basin to the ocean. The immense Lake Lahontan was one of a dozen or so large fresh-water lakes filling low valleys and large plains between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. This lake was so large that its many arms and embayments connected together to surround a group of mountain ranges, creating a vast island of rugged peaks and ridges.</p>
                <p>Looking at these tan desert floors, this aspect of the historical scene would be passed over by our understanding were we not aware of the geological evidence gathered by scientists over the last two hundred years. Armed with that knowledge, we can look across the scene and imagine the bright shining surfaces of water that once graced this view, where now lie only dust and dirt.</p>
