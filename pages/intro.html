           	    <h3>Appreciating Grand Landscapes</h3>
                <p>Magnificent landscapes, some of the grandest in the world, exist in the American West.  Over the course of my life I have searched for the best viewpoints from which to experience this great scenery.  During this time I came to understand certain principles that help to define what makes a scenic view great and how to best appreciate its grandeur.  These principles are codified in "The Seven Laws of the Great View," which are the subject of this website.  On each of seven pages I explain one of the Seven Laws and give one or two examples from among the many great views of the American West.</p>
        	    <p>I do not believe that I have invented these laws.  Rather, I have discovered something universal to the human experience of experiencing and enjoying nature at its grandest and most sublime, and these seven laws merely express ways in which we may enhance our understanding and appreciation of what we are seeing from these majestic overlooks.</p>
                <h3>The Photographs</h3>
        	    <p>My own photographic oeuvre was created many years ago when Kodachrome was king, so all of my own pictures are in a collection that has yet to be scanned and digitized, a process that will require cleaning many dusty slides.  For these examples I have borrowed from the Internet, choosing images that are in the public domain or for which permission has been granted, either with a Creative Commons License or similarly explicit written permission, or through direct communication with the creator of the photographic image.  At launch date of this site, permission for a few copyrighted images is currently under request. This is a noncommercial website. I encourage everyone to check out the Photo Credits page where I provide full attribution of and links to the marvelous creative efforts of these fine photographers. Also, if you want to view the photographs larger on a computer, use the browser's zoom to expand them.</p>
                <h3>My Next Website</h3>
                <p>My next project is to create a crowdsourcing website devoted to documenting the great viewpoints of the American West, and if that is successful, of the world. This website was coded entirely by me from scratch, and all of the content is my own. Right now I live a poor and frugal lifestyle. I would welcome some patronage to free me from employment so that I can devote myself entirely to what I consider to be this very worthy project. You can find out more about me by going to a personal website I created two years ago on yola.com. The URL is <a href="http://www.robertsturner52.yolasite.com/" target="_blank">www.robertsturner52.yolasite.com</a>. I can receive e-mail messages and PayPal donations at robertsturner52@gmail.com. I would love to hear from anyone who has found this website to their liking.</p>
