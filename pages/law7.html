                <h3>Connecting to the Earth</h3>
                <p>In the seven laws tradition, the seventh is different than the others, more profound and usually somewhat paradoxical. In this spirit, the Seventh Law of the Great View expresses what is most interesting and significant about these magnificent scenic vistas &mdash; their transformative effect upon those who experience a great view in all its grandeur. It is the inexorable consequence of the First Law, which requires the viewer to be firmly connected to the earth. This connection correlates with a dissolution of boundaries, a unifying of subject and object, and the viewer becoming fully integrated into the view.  Since a great view is necessarily large, the initial effect is for the viewer to seem extraordinarily small within the landscape's immensity.  The larger the vista, the smaller we miniscule humans appear at our center of the view.</p>
                <h3>Accessing Immensity within Ourself</h3>
                <p>And yet, paradoxically, the view also has the effect of magnifying our sense of self.  We are an unusual species, able to realize in our imaginations an incredible expansiveness of thought.  We look into the night sky and imagine voluminous glowing spheres of plasma that are the stars, vast galactic-scale clouds of gas, and ever more distant galaxies beyond counting.  While pondering a panoramic scene before us, we see, understand, and appreciate more than other creatures can.  We are blessed with a capacity to encompass the immensity, and this gives each of us a measure of magnificence that is shared with the view.</p>
                <h3>Identifying with the World Around Us</h3>
                <p>We are a part of the view, to be sure, but we also, in a way, merge with the whole. As we become one with its totality, so our sense of ourself is enlarged beyond measure.  At once we are both diminished and enlarged by our experience with a great view, making it one of the most direct and accessible means toward transcendence available in our brief lives.</p>
