                <p>ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WALKS IN AMERICA IS ALONG THE SOUTH RIM OF THE CHISOS MOUNTAINS IN SOUTHERN TEXAS.  FROM THIS GENTLE PATH ALONG THE PLATEAU'S EDGE THE HIKER CAN SEE THE ENTIRE BIG BEND OF THE RIO GRANDE, WHICH SEEMS CLOSE BY COMPARED TO THE FAR-OFF MOUNTAIN RANGES ACROSS THE CHIHUAHUAN DESERT OF MEXICO.</p>

                <p>I DON'T KNOW THE LOCATION OF THIS HILL, OR EVEN WHETHER IT IS IN EUROPE OR AMERICA, BUT IT HAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST VIEW PATHS, SO EMBLEMATIC OF THE SECOND LAW.</p>

                <h3>The Easy View and the Hard View</h3>
                <p>How one approaches a great viewpoint can influence the impact of the experience upon the viewer. While some overlooks are easy to achieve with a short walk or hike — a few of the best even just yards from where a car can park — this does not necessarily lessen the value of the experience. However, if some greater effort is made to get to a great view, it is likely to be accorded more concentration and value. At the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, the easy views are from the end of paved roads. Nearly all of the tourists visiting the North Rim go to two such spectacular overlooks, Point Imperial and Cape Royal.</p>
                <p>But to get to the finest Grand Canyon rim views one must venture far beyond the paved road that ends at the Grand Canyon Lodge.  A rugged four-wheel-drive dirt road takes one to the glorious Point Sublime, one of the grandest views on Earth, and a different, seldom travelled but easily traversed graded road ends at Monument Point, where one can see a whole seemingly hidden section of the Grand Canyon normally passed on by most visitors.  In many cases, the visitor will be entirely alone at these two viewpoints, able to experience the grandeur in solitude, letting the silence of civilization's absence bring forward the subtle sounds of the wilderness.</p>
                <h3>The Approach to the View</h3>
                <p>Also, it is often true that an approach may offer tantalizing glimpses of pieces of the view, all of which come together suddenly as one reaches the crest and summit of a peak.  The trail to the top of Clouds Rest shows the hiker beautiful scenery of Yosemite Valley and Half Dome, but completely hides the High Sierra behind the bulk of the mountain until one takes the final steps atop the summit, when all at once a panorama of cathedral-like mountain peaks unfolds before the viewer, taking one's breath away.</p>
                <p>Mountaineers who leave the maintained trail behind have a special experience with the landscape unequaled by those hiking along manicured paths.  Seeing raw nature beneath one's every step, or climbing on a cliff face with bare rock up close and personal, these wilderness travelers experience meadows, rocks, and mountain faces in a direct way that makes them so much more a part of the experience of the culminating view than if those natural pathways had been bypassed.</p>
