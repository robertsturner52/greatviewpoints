                <p>THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL IS NOT THE WORLD'S HIGHEST WATERFALL, THOUGH IT CERTAINLY RANKS UP NEAR THE TOP OF THE LIST. ITS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE, HOWEVER, LIES IN ITS UNUSUAL AESTHETIC FEATURES. THE WATER OF YOSEMITE CREEK, INSTEAD OF PLUNGING DOWN FROM THE RIM INSIDE A CLEFT, STRIKES OUT OVER A BROAD SHEER CLIFF FACE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE VALLEY, SO IT IS WIDELY VISIBLE FROM NUMEROUS VANTAGE PLACES, CATCHING THE SUN, AND THE WIND, THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE DAY.  ITS VISUAL PROMINENCE IS REMARKABLE, AS IF THE FALL WERE PURPOSEFULLY DISPLAYED AT THE CENTER OF AN IMMENSE GRANITE PLAQUE TO SHOW IT OFF. NEAR TO THE TOP, THE WATER COMING DOWN THE CREEK IS DIRECTED BY A NARROW CHANNEL ONTO A HARD ROCK LEDGE THAT REDIRECTS ALL OF THE FLOW HORIZONTALLY OUT AND AWAY FROM THE CLIFF FACE. MOMENTARILY SUSPENDED IN MID AIR, THE WATER BEGINS TO FALL UNIMPEDED BY ANY FURTHER CHANNELING OF THE ROCKS. WHILE MOST WATERFALLS HAVE THEIR SHAPES DEFINED BY THE ROCKS OVER AND AROUND WHICH THEY FLOW, YOSEMITE'S UPPER FALL INSTEAD TAKES ON THE UNUSUAL CHARACTER OF AN AIR-SCULPTED WATERFALL. THE RESULTING INTERPLAY OF WATER COMETS IS A JOY TO BEHOLD FROM UP CLOSE.</p>

                <p>ON THE LEFT IS THE VIEW OF YOSEMITE FALLS FROM GLACIER POINT. THE ENTIRE ROUTE TO THE TOP OF THE FALLS IS VISIBLE FROM HERE, SO IT IS BEST TO HIKE THAT TRAIL BEFORE DRIVING TO GLACIER POINT. ABOVE THE FALLS TO THE LEFT, THE HIGH POINT IS THE TOP OF THREE BROTHERS. ALSO KNOWN AS EAGLE PEAK, THIS WAS JOHN MUIR'S FAVORITE VALLEY VIEW, VISIBLE IN THE PHOTO ON THE RIGHT. BESIDES HALF DOME, ONE CAN ALSO MAKE OUT GLACIER POINT ACROSS THE VALLEY TO THE RIGHT AND CLOUDS REST HIGHER UP ALONG THE RIDGE TO THE LEFT. </p>

                <p>THIS IS THE CLASSIC VIEW FROM GLACIER POINT WITH HALF DOME, AND BEYOND IT THE HIGHER AND MORE MASSIVE CLOUDS REST, FORMING THE RIGHT SIDEWALL OF TENAYA CANYON. THE PHOTO SHOWS ONLY A SMALL SECTOR OF A MUCH LARGER PANORAMA VISIBLE FROM THE POINT. NO PHOTOGRAPH CANN DO JUSTICE TO THIS SCENE, AS THE UNNERVING CLOSENESS OF HALF DOME ACROSS THE CHASM OBVIATES ANY NEED TO USE A TELEPHOTO LENS TO CAPTURE THE GREAT DOME. TENAYA CANYON HAS ONLY A SMALL CREEK AND WATERSHED, BUT WAS MADE LARGE BY AN IMMENSE TONGUE OF ICE THAT FLOWED OVER TENAYA PASS FROM THE BASIN OF THE TUOLUMNE RIVER, WHICH WAS FILLED TO OVERFLOWING WITH GLACIAL ICE. TUOLUMNE ICE SPILLED OVER FIVE PASSES INTO THE MERCED DRAINAGE DURING THE LAST RELATIVELY SMALL GLACIATION 20,000 YEARS AGO, INCREASING THE CUTTING POWER OF THE GLACIERS THAT FORMED YOSEMITE VALLEY.</p>

               <p>GOING TO THE SUMMIT OF HALF DOME IS SO POPULAR THAT, LIKE HIKING UP MOUNT WHITNEY, A PERMIT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE ASCENT. IRONICALLY, THE VIEW FROM HALF DOME'S SUMMIT IS DEFICIENT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER VIEWS IN THE AREA BECAUSE THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURE IN REGION IN UNDER ONE'S FEET. IT IS THE APPROACH ITSELF, WRAPPING AROUND AND ONTO THE GRANITE DOME, THAT MAKES THE HIKE WORTH THE EFFORT. A BETTER VIEW &mdash; ONE OF YOSEMITE'S FINEST &mdash; IS ACHIEVED BY CLIMBING THE NEXT PEAK UP ALONG THE RIDGE, CLOUDS REST, AN IMMENSE MASS OF GRANITE, WHOSE SUMMIT IS VISIBLE PEEKING BEHIND HALF DOME IN MOST VIEWS OF THE FAMOUS LANDMARK. THESE TWO PICTURES SHOW THE VIEW FROM CLOUDS REST, FIRST BACK TOWARD HALF DOME AND THE VALLEY, WITH GLACIER POINT VISIBLE JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOME, AND SECOND UP TOWARD THE HIGH SIERRA PORTION OF THE YOSEMITE REGION, THROUGH WHICH TRAVELERS CAN DRIVE ON THE TIOGA ROAD. THE ROAD PASSES BY TENAYA LAKE, VISIBLE IN THE CENTER OF THIS VIEW. POLLY DOME, THE ROUNDED MOUNTAIN ABOVE THE LAKE, WAS ENTIRELY COVERED BY GLACIAL ICE MOVING THROUGH TENAYA PASS DURING THE ICE AGE.</p>

                <h3>A Fuller Appreciation of a Landscape</h3>
                <p>There are some special places, like Yosemite Valley and the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, where the features of the scene are so numerous and interesting as to demand viewing from many angles. In these cases one can gain a fuller appreciation of the landscape by visiting several overlooks. This law is so intuitively obvious that it is practiced by many tourists and mountaineers alike.  Few are those who settle for just going to one overlook on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon before taking off for another destination in the state. After walking around valley floor, the visitor to Yosemite is remiss not to take in the view from Glacier Point, but there are so many more significant viewpoints that are essential to capturiing Yosemite's full grandeur.  A hike up beside the Upper Yosemite Fall, where one can leave the trail to climb among the rocks at the base to experience the great cataract from within its mist, gives one a truer feel for the great height of the waterfall and will later add to the appreciation of the scenes on the valley floor and from Glacier Point, where Yosemite Falls is but a single, albeit significant, detail of the great view. One should continue on up the trail to the top of the fall and beyond to the summit of Eagle Peak atop Three Brothers, a prominent feature on the north side of the valley. The other necessary hike is up the Mist Trail to the top of Nevada Fall, and if one has the energy and navigational skills, to the incredible Diving Board halfway up the south side of Half Dome. Additional views of El Capitan and the western part of Yosemite Valley from Taft, Dewey, and Old Inspiration Points on the south rim, and the feature-rich panoramas from the top of Sentinel Dome, Half Dome, and Clouds Rest, give the dedicated explorer a vastly more complete appreciation and understanding of one of earth's great places.</p>
                <p>The same is true for every mountain range. Fifteen special summits that dot the map of the Sierra Nevada from the north edge of Yosemite National Park to Olancha Peak south of Mount Whitney are designated "Emblem Peaks" by the Sierra Club because of their spectacular vistas of the surrounding range and beyond. From each of these summits one can see afar to several of the other mountains on the list. Experiencing the view from each of these summits lets one combine all of the scenes into a visual representation akin to a three-dimensional topographic model in the mind.</p>
                <h3>A Mental Map of the Land</h3>
                <p>Out across the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah are range after range of high upland mountains separated by deep low desert basins.  Highways across this land skirt around and between the ranges, rarely going over them, so the casual traveler sees only the desert lowland scene with the mountains above. But venture into the range and one climbs through green hills and forested highlands, soon reaching the tundra of the heights before finding scenic vistas along the crest.  Native Americans, and later the earliest fur trappers, knew this landscape as a kind of paradise, abundant in water and game while it remained unexploited by the eventual rapacious hordes of hunters, miners, ranchers, and farmers.</p>
                <p>The earliest explorers, who came into the West before the advent of maps, written guidebooks, or designated wagon trails, memorized features of the land as they traveled through it, creating a mental landscape map. Viewing one distant range from high in another, getting to know a mountain's particular shape and individual features from various directions, these men developed an awareness of the land that was better in many ways than any map one could draw, because it was composed of real experience and knowledge of the land.</p>

                </div>
                <p>LOOKING LIKE THE FRONT OF AN IMMENSE GOTHIC CATHEDRAL, THE RUGGED ECHO PEAKS ON THE LEFT DOMINATE THE SCENE TO THE NORTHEAST FROM THE SUMMIT OF CLOUDS REST, TOWERING OVER THE PASS THAT TAKES THE JOHN MUIR TRAIL TOWARD TUOLUMNE MEADOWS. THE HIGHER PEAK DIRECTLY TO THE RIGHT, KNOWN AS THE COCKSCOMB, IS ALSO A WORTHY MEMBER OF YOSEMITE'S ENSEMBLE OF GREAT SCENIC VIEWPOINTS. PERCHED BETWEEN TWO DRAINAGES, THESE RUGGED PEAKS AND RIDGES WERE EXPOSED THROUGHOUT THE ICE AGE, WITHSTANDING THE ONSLAUGHT OF ICE FLOWING AROUND THEM AS IT SPILLED FROM THE TUOLUMNE MER DE GLACE, OVER THE DIVIDE, AND DOWN INTO THE MERCED RIVER BASIN BEFORE HEADING INTO YOSEMITE VALLEY. THE ROUNDED LANDSCAPE BELOW THESE PEAKS WAS SMOOTHED OVER WHEN IT WAS BURIED BENEATH THE MOVING ICE.</p>
