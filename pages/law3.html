                <p>THE GRAND CANYON OF THE YELLOWSTONE RIVER OPENS AT THE LOWER FALL, WHICH SERVES AS THE CENTERPIECE TO EVERY VIEW LOOKING UPRIVER FROM THE SOUTH OR NORTH RIM. IN DISTANT VIEWS, HOWEVER, SUCH AS THE FAMOUS SCENE FROM ARTIST POINT BELOW, THE SIZE OF THE WATERFALL IS NEARLY LOST AMID THE CANYON'S SPECTACULARLY COLORED VOLCANIC ROCK WALLS, WHICH IS WHY FIRST MAKING A DESCENT TO THE LIP OF THE FALL IS SO VALUABLE. LEANING OVER THE ANCHORED METAL RAILING A MERE YARDS ABOVE THE RAGING TORRENT GIVES ONE A VISCERAL SENSE OF THE SIZE AND POWER OF THE RIVER AS IT PLUNGES OVER THE EDGE INTO THE GORGE. CLOSE BY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THER RIVER, A WALK DOWN UNCLE TOM'S TRAIL GETS THE HIKER BELOW AND NEAR TO THE FALL, WHICH AT 308 FEET IS NEARLY TWICE AS HIGH AS NIAGARA FALLS. TAKING IN THE VIEW FROM ONE OF THE DISTANT OVERLOOKS ON THE RIM SHOULD COME AFTER A CLOSEUP VIEW OF THE FALL, SO AS TO BETTER APPRECIATE THE OVERALL SCALE OF THE CANYON.</p>

                <h3>Enlarging the Landscape</h3>
                <p>When looking upon a vast panoramic landscape, filled with details that stretch out across the land for tens or even hundreds of miles, often the multitudinous detail seems small and is easy to overlook.  Like people seen from a skyscaper, who appear ant-like from a thousand feet up, the buildings and farms, highways and roads, cities and towns, and hills and ridges viewed across the distance appear miniscule in the overall scene. However, if one has been to a few of these places before gazing out at them from above, the viewer will be able to place in mind an image of the feature as seen from close by to compare with the distant view. Most features seen from this far away must be considerably large. The memory of having been near one is accompanied by awareness of its great size. In looking upon it from afar, one can transpose that awareness of its size onto the tiny detail seen in the panoram, thereby increasing the feeling of immensity and vastness for the overall scene before the viewer.</p>
                <h3>Details in the View</h3>
	            <p>The immense 360-degree panorama from the top of Mount Diablo east of San Francisco is a perfect example of how this quality plays out.  From atop the mountain on a clear day one can see nearly two hundred miles of the Sierra Nevada stretching from north to south, horizon to horizon.  Between and below one is the expanse of Central Valley, dotted with cities and towns &mdash; Sacramento over there, Stockton right down there &mdash; and the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, with its estuaries and sloughs spread out like a map below you.  Turn 180 degrees and San Francisco Bay, from one end to the other, fills a large part of the scene.  The height of the mountain is sufficient to see the horizon of the Pacific Ocean over San Francisco, so that the city appears as the peninsula it is.</p>
	            <p>From this overlook the viewer can pick out details that have been visited on other days: the Bay Area bridges, seemingly so small, like toys on a model railroad, or the cooling towers of the now-closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Facility.  Sutter Buttes appear as mere small mounds alongside the great mountain range of the Sierra Nevada, but anyone who has driven by them knows how large they are.  Knowing the large size of these smaller features within the scene gives one a scale with which to appreciate the true immensity of the overall vista that is unfolded before the viewer.</p>

                <p>THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN ARIZONA, OVER A MILE DEEP WHERE IT CUTS THROUGH THE KAIBAB PLATEAU, IS OF A SIZE DIFFICULT FOR THE MIND TO FATHOM. A DESCENT TO THE RIVER FROM THE SOUTH RIM BY FOOT OR BURRO HELPS TO APPRECIATE ITS SCALE. TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY DOWN, A SIDE TRAIL TAKES ONE TO PLATEAU POINT, A VIEWPOINT PERCED ON THE EDGE OF THE TONTO PLATFORM OVERLOOKING THE CANYON'S INNER GORGE. YOU CAN SEE THIS TRAIL, AND THE POINT, IN THE PICTURE TO THE LEFT, WHICH SHOWS THE INNER GORGE DEEP INSIDE THE CANYON. THE PHOTO TO THE RIGHT SHOWS THE VIEWPOINT, WHICH IS 1300 FEET ABOVE THE RIVER. BY ITSELF, THE INNER GORGE IS A SPECTACULAR CANYON, AND WOULD BE WORTHY OF RECOGNITION EVEN IF IT WERE ERODING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF A BROAD FLAT PLAIN. INSTEAD, IT IS NEARLY LOST IN THE OVERALL VIEW OF THE LARGER GRAND CANYON. KNOWING THE IMMENSE SIZE OF THIS INNER GORGE HELPS TO IMPART FOR THE VIEWER ON THE RIM THE TRUE SCALE OF THIS MAGNIFICENT GEOLOGICAL WONDER.
