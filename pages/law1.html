               <p>THE MOST AESTHETICALLY PLEASING VIEWS HAVE LAYERS OF LANDSCAPE LEADING OFF INTO THE DISTANCE, LIKE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL VIEW FROM MUMMY MOUNTAIN IN NEVADA'S SPRING MOUNTAINS. BESIDES THE IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND THAT IS NOT EVIDENT IN THIS PHOTO, THE VIEW HAS A PROMINENT MIDDLE GROUND BEFORE THE WONDERFULLY CONTOURED LAYERS OF NEARER AND MORE DISTANT MOUNTAIN RANGES STRETCHING OFF TO THE HORIZON.</p>

                </div>
                <p>FOREGROUND ROCKS ON MT. WHITNEY'S SUMMIT DELINEATE THE SPACE BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN'S EAST FACE AND THE LOWER RIDGES AND MOUNTAINS LEADING DOWN INTO OWENS VALLEY, OVER TWO VERTICAL MILES BELOW. THE HEIGHT OF THE MOUNTAIN ALLOWS THE VIEWER TO SEE OVER THE TOP OF THE INYO MOUNTAINS, 20 MILES AWAY, TO THE MORE DISTANT RANGES IN THE NEVADA'S GREAT BASIN.</p>

                <h3>Tangent to the Earth</h3>
                <p>The great view is always a ground-based view.  It is not a view from an airplane, or from a hang glider.  It is not a view from a kite or a view picture taken with a camera on a drone.  The great view is what it is partly because we, the viewers, are part of the view itself.  We stand upon Earth, tangent with the immense sphere, gazing from our little spot on the planet, past the foreground rocks and plants, out across the land, beyond to the horizon, and, in our imagination, on beyond what we can see.  We are on the land and in the view, just as much as that bush or that tree, or any animals that we see in the natural habitat around us.</p>
                <h3>Inhabiting the View</h3>
                <p>By including ourselves in the view, there is a dissolve between the subjective and the objective, the two merging as one.  This experience is not possible when looking out the window of a plane or through goggles while hang gliding or parachuting.  For us to gather the full measure of its magnificence, the great view must include you, looking at the land and appreciating its grandeur, doing what we humans do better than any other sentient creature in our planetary realm.</p>
